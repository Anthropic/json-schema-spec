                JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of which is JSON instance UI generation.
                This document specifies a vocabulary for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON documents,
                provide hints for user interfaces working with JSON data,
                and to make assertions about what a valid document must look like.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance)
                satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are asserted by using
                keywords described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords
                is also defined to assist in interactive, user interface instance generation.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification will use the terminology defined by the
                <xref target="json-schema">JSON Schema core</xref> specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
            <t>
                <!-- The text in this section has been copied from the official boilerplate,
                and should not be modified.-->

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
                "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and
                object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements
                or object member values.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "property set" to refer to the set of an object's
                member names; for instance, the property set of JSON Object { "a": 1, "b": 2 } is
                [ "a", "b" ].
            </t>
            <t>
                Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array
                are <xref target="json-schema">equal</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Overview">
            <t>
                The UI Schema is to allow all the work creating a JSON Schema to pay off with a working user interface.
            </t>
            <t>
                While.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability considerations">

            <section title="Regular expressions">
                <t>
                    Two validation keywords, "pattern" and "patternProperties", use regular
                    expressions to express constraints. These regular expressions SHOULD
                    be valid according to the <xref target="ecma262">ECMA 262</xref> regular
                    expression dialect.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support,
                    schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression
                    tokens:

                    <list>
                        <t>individual Unicode characters, as defined by the <xref
                        target="RFC7159">JSON specification</xref>;</t>
                        <t>simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);</t>
                        <t>complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);</t>
                        <t>simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "*" (zero or more), "?" (zero or
                        one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "*?", "??");</t>
                        <t>range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at least x, at
                        most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy
                        versions;</t>
                        <t>the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;</t>
                        <t>simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                    Finally, implementations MUST NOT take regular expressions to be
                    anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end. This means, for instance,
                    the pattern "es" matches "expression".

                    This keyword plays no role in validation per se. Its role is to provide

                    Both of these keywords can be used to decorate a user interface with
                    information about the data produced by this user interface. A title will
                    preferably be short, whereas a description will provide explanation about
                    the purpose of the instance described by this schema.

                    This keyword can be used to supply a default JSON value associated with a

                JSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and concerns all the security considerations listed there.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which have numerous different (often incompatible) implementations.
                Some implementations allow the embedding of arbitrary code, which is outside the scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted.
                Regular expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to compute (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"),
                resulting in a denial-of-service attack.
